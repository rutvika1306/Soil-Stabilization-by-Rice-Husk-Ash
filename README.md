# Soil-Stabilization-by-Rice-Husk-Ash
A geotechnical engineering project analyzing the effect of Rice Husk Ash (RHA) on soil stabilization. The study involves laboratory testing of soil properties with varying percentages of RHA and evaluating improvements in strength, compaction, and plasticity characteristics.

# Soil Stabilization using Rice Husk Ash (RHA)

This project explores the use of **Rice Husk Ash (RHA)** as a sustainable additive for soil stabilization.  
The objective is to improve soil engineering properties such as strength, compaction, and plasticity by partially replacing soil with RHA.

## üåç Motivation
- Problem: Weak/expansive soils pose challenges in construction (roads, foundations, embankments).
- Solution: Utilize agricultural waste like **Rice Husk Ash** as an eco-friendly stabilizer.
- Impact: Promotes sustainable construction while improving soil strength and durability.

## üî¨ Methodology
1. **Soil Sample Collection** ‚Äì Expansive/weak soil from local site.
2. **Rice Husk Ash Preparation** ‚Äì Obtained by controlled burning of rice husk.
3. **Mix Proportions** ‚Äì Soil samples mixed with RHA in varying percentages (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%).
4. **Laboratory Tests Conducted:**
   - Atterberg Limits
   - Standard Proctor Test (Compaction)
   - Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS)
   - California Bearing Ratio (CBR)
5. **Analysis** ‚Äì Compare results of plain soil vs. soil + RHA mixtures.

## üìä Expected Outcomes
- Reduction in plasticity index (PI).
- Increase in maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC).
- Improvement in strength and CBR value.
- Cost-effective and eco-friendly soil improvement method.
